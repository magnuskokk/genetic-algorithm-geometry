## Currently only produces random concave 2d shapes on a canvas.

# Hypothesis:
### Make a genetic algorithm to generate random 2d shapes and roll them down a hill. The genetic algorithm would evolve those who rolled down faster due to being rounder thus making them more round. Eventually the convex circle shound win.
